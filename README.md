# Numerical Analysis Lab - 1st task

The following tasks were completed using MATLAB Online:

## Task_101
Complete the following tasks of matrix manipulation:

- Define two matrices A & B. The values of these matrix will be taken as input from command-line
- Print the max value from matrix A
- Multiply matrix A & B. Handle the case where multiplication can not be possible(print proper message/resulten matrix).

`Sample input:`

```
[1 8 7; 6 7 8; 5 6 9]
[1 7 3; 5 5 1; 8 1 2]
```
## Task_102

Implement root finding **Bisection** method.

- Store root of each iteration in a matrix.
- Plot the equation with the matrix of root so that the graphical view of finding roots can be achieved.

`Sample input:`

```
@(x) x.^3 - x.^2 + 2
-200
200
30
10^-6
```
## Task_103
Implement root finding **False-position** method.

- Store root of each iteration in a matrix.
- Plot the equation with the matrix of root so that the graphical view of finding roots can be achieved.
`Sample input:`

```
@(x) x.^2 - 3
1
2
10
10^-6
```
## Task_104
Implement root finding **Newton-raphson** method.

- Store root of each iteration in a matrix.
- Plot the equation with the matrix of root so that the graphical view of finding roots can be achieved.
- `Bonus(+5)`: Draw the tangent/slope line you found at each iteration.
`Sample input:`

```
@(x) x.^3 - x.^2 + 2
@(x) 3*x.^2 - 2*x
-200
20
10^-6
```
